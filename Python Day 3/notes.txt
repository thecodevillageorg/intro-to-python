- Variables and Variable Naming Rules

A variable is:
- the location of storage
- a container to store some kind of info for use at a later time
- retrievable by referring to a name that describes said information

#Ex:
first_string_var = "First String"  
first_int_var = 1
total = 1 + 2 * 3

Variable Naming Rules:
- It may only contain letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers or the underscore character _.
- It may not start with a number.
- It may not be a keyword (you will learn about them later on).
- It may not contain spaces

#Ex:
# No spaces are allowed in the variable
# first string value = "First string"

#Ex:
# Cannot start with a number
1st_string_value = "First String"

#Ex:
# Cannot be a keyword
True = "True"

Data Types
- Are how we define values, like words or numbers. If you were to be asked what a sentence is made up of,
you would probably reply with "words or characters". Well, in programming,
we call them strings. Just the same as we refer to numbers as their own data type as well.
Data types define what we can do and how these values are stored in memory on the computer

Examples of Data Types:
Integer - These are whole numbers e.g 5
number1 = 5
print(number1)
Float - These are decimal numbers e.g 5.7
number2 = 5.7
print(number2)
Boolean - These are True or False values e.g True
switch = True
print(switch)
String - These are characters within quotes e.g "Hello"
greeting = "Hello"
print(greeting)
